 30 Days, 30 Projects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Welcome to the “30 Days, 30 Projects” repository! This repository contains a series of small projects developed over the course of thirty days, aimed at improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each day features a new project, with its own folder containing the necessary files.
